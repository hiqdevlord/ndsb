I finished the competition with 22nd position (with small difference(?) from the winning solution)! 
I participated this competition to wrap-up and study the recent deep learning techniques, so I want to share my experiences.

At first, 

I want to try 
1. new models
- googlenet
2. new training technies
- batch normalization
1. cxx_net
2. variation of cxx_net
3. googlenet for DNSB
